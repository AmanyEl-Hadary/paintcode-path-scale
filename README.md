# PaintCodeScale

`UIBezierPath`s generated by [PaintCode](https://www.paintcodeapp.com/) App are sometimes offscreen when imported to iOS,
use this `UIBezierPath` extension to fit and center into desired `CGRect`.

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 7.3

## Installation

Drag `UIBezierPath+.swift` into your project.

## Usage

After pasting the PaintCode generated code into your app, replace `UIBezierPath.fill()` in PaintCode code by 

```swift
bezierPath.fit(into: rect).moveCenter(to: rect.center).fill()
```

This scale the bezier path bound rect to fit into **rect** without loosing quality and then center into the **rect** center.
